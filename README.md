The "Dogs vs Cats" project is a computer vision task aimed at classifying images of dogs and cats using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
It leverages the Kaggle dataset, which contains labeled images of dogs and cats for training and testing.
The project preprocesses images to ensure uniform input size and augments the data to enhance model generalization. 
A CNN architecture is designed and trained to extract features and distinguish between the two classes.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss are employed to assess the model's performance,
with iterative improvements made based on validation results. The project demonstrates the practical application of deep learning for image classification tasks.
